# Notes about O-RAN Architecture and its Security

My personal notes about the O-RAN architecture and security problems. I summarized relevant papers in the space of O-RAN that explain the underlying O-RAN architecture as well as related security problems. I made these notes to the best of my knowledge, however there may still be errors, misconceptions and typos in these notes. I also originally created these notes for myself, but maybe they can help someone understand this topic faster.

This page is just a compilation of all these independent notes.
