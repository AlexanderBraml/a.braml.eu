{"/":{"title":"Alexander Braml","content":"\n# About Me\n\nI am a computer science student enrolled at the [University of Passau](https://www.uni-passau.de/), specializing in software development. My programming journey began a few years ago when I started working with an Arduino, exploring the realm of embedded systems. Over time, my focus shifted primarily towards Python, although I occasionally work with C++ as well. Additionally, I have experience working with Java.\n\n## What I'm currently working on\n\nCurrently, I am actively involved as a student assistant at the [Chair of Computer Engineering](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/technische-informatik/). In this role, I am dedicated to developing a comprehensive test framework that enables automatic and reliable hardware testing.\n\nAdditionally, I have just commenced work on an exciting project with the objective of hacking a Eurobalise, a critical communication link connecting ground stations with trains. This endeavor serves as a notable component of my involvement in the [Digital Rail Summer School 2023](https://osm.hpi.de/drss/2023/) hosted by the Hasso Plattner Institut.\n\n## What I enjoy doing\n\nDuring my free time, I find joy in various activities. One of my favorite things is exploring the outdoors through mountain biking, often embarking on multi-day adventures when bikepacking. Additionally, I indulge in bouldering and enjoy the company of friends who share these passions.\n\nAnother fascination of mine lies in the world of cars and motorsports. I hold a special love for classic rallye cars, with a particular fondness for the iconic Audi Quattro.\n\nI am also an active firefighter, trained in wearing respiratory protection equipment.\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-11T22:52:49.865462963Z","tags":[]}}
